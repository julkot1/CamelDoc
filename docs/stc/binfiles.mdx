## Binary file structure

Binary file contains structure of program divided into sections.
:::note[`C` representation of program in `STCVM`]
```C
struct program
{
    program_meta *meta;
    pool_element *const_pool;
    element *var_pool;
    function *functions;
    void *const_pool_stack;
    element *stack;
};
```
:::


### Header Section
Header Section has got program metadata:
- `const_pool_size`: size of constant pool
- `functions_size`: number of functions in program
- `labels_size`: number of labels in program
- `stack_size`: size of program stack
- `var_pool_size`: size of variable pool available for program
- `const_stack_size`: size of constant pool stack where constants are stored

:::note[`C` representation of Header Section in `STCVM`]
```C
struct program_meta
{
    size_t const_pool_size;
    size_t functions_size;
    size_t labels_size;
    size_t stack_size;
    size_t var_pool_size;
    size_t const_stack_size;
};
```
:::

### Constants Definitions Section
Constants Definitions Section contains all constants definitions used in program. Constants values are stored in next section constant pool. This section is an array of `pool_element` structures. Each `pool_element` structure contains type, size of constant and address to constant value.
The constant could be of type `string` and `array`
:::note[`C` representation of pool_element in `STCVM`]
```C
typedef pool_element
{
    type t;
    size_t size;
    size_t addr;
};
```
:::

### Constants Pool Section
Constants Pool Section contains all constants values used in program.

### Functions Definition Section
This section are array of `function` structures. Each `function` structure contains:
- `name`: name of function (max 32 characters)
- `num_args`: number of arguments
- `id`: unique id of function
- `addr`: address of operations in binary file
- `code_size`: size of operations in binary file

:::note[`C` representation of function in `STCVM`]
```C
strucr function
{
    size_t num_args;
    size_t id;
    size_t code_size;
    char name[32];
    size_t code_addr;
};
```
:::

### Operations Section
Operations Section contains all operations used in program. Each operation is represented by `operation` structure. The `operation` structure contains:
- `opcode`: operation code
- `payload_type`: type of payload
- `payload`: value of payload

Readmore about operations in [Operations](/docs/stc/vm#operations)

:::note[`C` representation of operation in `STCVM`]
```C
operation struct
{
    opcode code;
    type payload_type;
    value payload;
} ;
```
:::

### Variables Pool Section

This pool is used to store variables in program. Each variable is represented by `element` structure. Pool could only store simple types like `number`, `ptr`, `type`, `bool` and `char`. Complex variables like `array` and `string` are stored in constant pool or in heap and can be accessed by `ptr` type.
The `element` structure contains:
- `t`: type of variable
- `val`: value of variable

:::note[`C` representation of element in `STCVM`]
```C
struct element
{
    type t;
    value val;
};
```
:::

### Stack Section

This section is used to store program stack. Stack is represented by `element` structure like in [Variables Pool Section](#variables-pool-section)
